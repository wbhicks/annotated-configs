NOT FOR FINAL SUBMISSION - THIS IS A UNIT-TESTING VERSION - PLEASE DISREGARD
This version is NOT intended to adhere to the PM1QT specs and submission requirements 
- in followup to my email to Dr. Hugue, this version uses both a PM1QT and a couple 
of TreeMaps to allow me to unit-test the correctness of the QT. So, please disregard 
this submission, if you are not Dr. Hugue and therefore didn't read my email 
requesting permission for this "dummy" submission. 

source code derivations:
In Parser.java, two methods (isWS and topLevel) by Evan Machusak (changes by wbhicks).
In Parser.java, changeStdIn implements David Anderson's posted idea.
